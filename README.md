# Beekeeper Registration

Service running on the nodes that registers with beekeeper and downloads reverse tunnel credentials to be used by https://github.com/waggle-sensor/waggle-bk-reverse-tunnel.

> The legacy Beehive registration and reverse tunnel services used to be built here as 1.x.y versions.  These services have been moved to their repository: https://github.com/waggle-sensor/node-registration-service
